# Version 0.4.4

- Changed argument structure
- Added auto-config file creation (buildwars.toml)

- Known issues:
  - buildwars.toml is created in the current directory, not $HOME/.buildwars.toml as I wished

# Version 0.4.3

- Updated to March balance string for output builds
- Changed formatting to work better without modifications -- mostly sectioning

# Version 0.4.2 and earlier

- Initial release of 'automatic' export-character-to-build-website tool
